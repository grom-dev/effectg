 *
 * > **Example:** A [poll bot](https://t.me/PollBot) for groups runs in privacy mode (only receives commands, replies to its messages and mentions). There could be two ways to create a new poll:
 * >
 * > -   Explain the user how to send a command with parameters (e.g. /newpoll question answer1 answer2). May be appealing for hardcore users but lacks modern day polish.
 * > -   Guide the user through a step-by-step process. 'Please send me your question', 'Cool, now let's add the first answer option', 'Great. Keep adding answer options, then send /done when you're ready'.
 * >
 * > The last option is definitely more attractive. And if you use [ForceReply](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#forcereply) in your bot's questions, it will receive the user's answers even if it only receives replies, commands and mentions - without any extra work for the user.
